`(n)!` denotes the factorial function on the natural numbers.
The parentheses are mandatory when writing.
Use `calc` to prove this.
You can use `exact?` to find lemmas from the library,
such as the fact that factorial is monotone. -/
example (n m k : ℕ) (h : n ≤ m) : (n)! ∣ (m + 1)! := by

    a + exp x ≤ c + exp (y + 2) := by
  sorry
  done

-- Use `rw?` or `rw??` to help you in the following calculation.
-- Alternatively, write out a calc block by hand.
example {G : Type*} [Group G] {a b c d : G}
    (h : a⁻¹ * b * c * c⁻¹ * a * b⁻¹ * a * a⁻¹ = b) (h' : b * c = c * b) : b = 1 := by

/-- Prove the following using `linarith`.
Note that `linarith` cannot deal with implication or if and only if statements. -/
example (a b c : ℝ) : a + b ≤ c ↔ a ≤ c - b := by
  constructor
  intro h1
  linarith
  intro h2
  linarith
  done


/- You can prove many equalities and inequalities by being smart with calculations.
In this case `linarith` can also prove this, but `calc` can be a lot more flexible. -/
example {x y : ℝ} (hx : x + 3 ≤ 2) (hy : y + 2 * x ≥ 3) : y > 3 := by
  calc
    y = y + 2 * x - 2 * x := by ring
    _ ≥ 3 - 2 * x := by gcongr
    _ = 9 - 2 * (x + 3) := by ring
    _ ≥ 9 - 2 * 2 := by gcongr
    _ > 3 := by norm_num

/-- It can be useful to add a `+ 0` in a calculational proof for `gcongr` -/
example {m n : ℤ} : n ≤ n + m ^ 2 := by
  -- gcongr doesn't make progress here
  calc
    n = n + 0 := by ring
    _ ≤ n + m ^ 2 := by gcongr; exact sq_nonneg m

/- Sometimes `congr`/`gcongr` goes too deep into a term.
In that case, you can give `gcongr` a pattern with how deep it should enter the terms.
When the pattern contains `?_`, it creates a subgoal with the corresponding terms
on each side of the inequality.
For `congr` you can also do this using the tactic `congrm`. -/
example {a₁ a₂ b₁ b₂ c₁ c₂ : ℝ} (hab : a₁ + a₂ = b₁ + b₂) (hbc : b₁ + b₂ ≤ c₁ + c₂) :
    a₁ + a₂ + 1 ≤ c₁ + c₂ + 1 := by
  calc a₁ + a₂ + 1 = b₁ + b₂ + 1 := by congrm ?_ + 1; exact hab
    _ ≤ c₁ + c₂ + 1 := by gcongr ?_ + 1 -- gcongr automatically applies `hbc`.
