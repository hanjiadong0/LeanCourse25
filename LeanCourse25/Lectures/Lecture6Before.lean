/- # Last time

Last time we saw:

* More on orders: `gcongr` and `grw`
* The tactic cheatsheet
* Sets:
  - `Set α` is the type of sets with elements from `α`
  - Common notation can be used: `x ∈ s`, `s ⊆ t`, `s ∪ t`, `∅`, ...
  - Prove two sets equal by using the `ext` tactic.
  - We can use the notation `{x : α | P x}` for the set of elements satisfying `P`.
  - Unions/intersections: `⋃ i : ι, C i`, `⋃ i ∈ s, C i` or `⋃₀ C`;
-/

/- # Today: Sets (continued), numbers -/

/- We can take images and preimages of sets.

`f ⁻¹' s` is the preimage of `s` under `f`.
`f '' s` is the image of `s` under `f`.

On paper, you would write `f(A)` or `f[A]` for the image
and `f⁻¹(B)` or `f⁻¹[B]` for the preimage.
This notation is hard to parse for Lean, since parentheses and ⁻¹
have so many different meanings in mathematics.
Therefore we use this funny notation.

Lean has the following names for intervals:

Icc a b = [a, b]
Ico a b = [a, b)
Ioc a b = (a, b]
Ioo a b = (a, b)

/- # Numbers -/

/-
Some useful tactics when dealing with numbers:
* `norm_num`: compute equalities and inequalities involving numerals
* `cutsat`: can do linear arithmetic on `ℕ` and `ℤ`.
* `positivity`: can show that something is positive/non-negative
  by using that its components are positive/non-negative.
* `field_simp` can simplify divisions.
-/

example : 2 ^ 3 + 17 = 300 / 12 := by norm_num

example (x : ℝ) : x + 5 + 3 = x + 8 := by
  sorry
  done

example (n m : ℤ) : 2 * n + 1 ≠ 2 * m := by cutsat

example (n m k : ℝ) (hn : 0 < n) (hm : 0 ≤ m) (hk : 0 < k) :
    0 < n * m + k  := by positivity

example (x y : ℝ) (hy : y ≠ 0) :
    2 * x / y + 1 + x * y = (2 * x + y) / y + y * x := by
  field_simp




/- **Warning**
Division and subtraction of natural numbers
again returns a natural number.
This is division rounded down and truncated subtraction.

#eval 7 - 6

#eval 7 - 8



/- ## Coercions
When using subtraction and division, it is better to
do the calculation in the rationals or reals.

We write the type ascription `(<expression> : ℚ)` to tell Lean
that the expression should be interpreted as a rational number.

If you give a natural number expression, and tell Lean that it
should be a rational number, Lean will automatically
insert *coercions*, or canonical inclusions, in the expression.
In the infoview (right half of your screen),
these coercions are denoted with `↑`.

Coercions are used widely, between many types.
-/

#eval (12 : ℚ) / 15
#eval (7 : ℤ) - 8

variable (n : ℕ)
#check (n : ℚ)
#check (n + 1 : ℚ)
#check ((n - 3) / 2 : ℝ)



/- If you want precise control where the coercion is inserted,
you can use `↑` or a double type ascription.
However, just writing `↑` without any type information often doesn't
give Lean enough information to know what you mean. -/

#check (↑(n + 1) : ℚ)
#check ((n + 1 : ℕ) : ℚ)
#check ((n + 1 : ℤ) : ℚ)

#check ↑(n + 1)




/-
Some tactics that are useful when working with coercions:
* `norm_cast`: pull coercions out of an expression.
  E.g. turn `↑n * ↑m + ↑k` into `↑(n * m + k)`
* `push_cast`: push coercions into an expression.
  E.g. turn `↑(n * m + k)` into `↑n * ↑m + ↑k`

Note: Sometimes you need additional hypotheses to pull/push casts
out of/into `-` or `/`, since `↑n - ↑m = ↑(n - m)` and
`↑n / ↑m = ↑(n / m)` are not always true.
-/

example (n : ℕ) : ((n + 1 : ℤ) : ℚ) = n + 1 := by norm_cast

example (n m : ℕ) (h : m ∣ n) : (↑(n / m) : ℚ) = ↑n / ↑m := by norm_cast

/- # Recursion and induction

Let's start by defining our own factorial function.
Note that there is no `:=` -/

def fac : ℕ → ℕ
  | 0     => 1
  | n + 1 => (n + 1) * fac n



lemma fac_zero : fac 0 = 1 := by rfl

lemma fac_succ (n : ℕ) : fac (n + 1) = (n + 1) * fac n := by rfl

example : fac 4 = 24 := by rfl

#eval fac 100




/- Lean checks that every function is *terminating*. If it isn't,
you have to mark it `partial` and cannot use it in proofs. -/
partial def wrong : ℕ → ℕ
  | n => 1 + wrong (n + 1)


/- ## Induction -/

/- Let's prove that the factorial function we just defined
is always positive. -/

lemma fac_pos (n : ℕ) : 0 < fac n := by
  sorry
  done





/- Next we define the fib numbers.
We mark it with `@[simp]`: this is an *attribute* that tells
the `simp` tactic to simplify its definition whenever it can.
-/

@[simp] def fib : ℕ → ℕ
  | 0 => 0
  | 1 => 1
  | n + 2 => fib n + fib (n + 1)

example (n : ℕ) : fib (n + 2) = fib n + fib (n + 1) := by
  simp




lemma fib_add (m n : ℕ) : fib (m + n + 1) =
    fib m * fib n + fib (m + 1) * fib (n + 1) := by
  sorry
  done








/-
Note: in the above proof, if we use `induction n` then our
induction hypothesis is "for this specific `m`, we have
`fib (m + n + 1) = fib m * fib n + fib (m + 1) * fib (n + 1)`".

If we use `induction n generalizing m` then our
induction hypothesis is "for all `m`, we have
`fib (m + n + 1) = fib m * fib n + fib (m + 1) * fib (n + 1)`".

open Finset

/- We can use `∑ i ∈ range n, f i` to take the sum `f 0 + f 1 + ⋯ + f (n - 1)`. -/

/-
Here `range n` or `Finset.range n` is the set `{0, ..., n - 1}`.
Its type is `Finset ℕ`, which is a finite set of natural numbers
(We will talk more about finite sets in a later lecture.)
-/

#check Finset.range





/- We will prove the basic equality: `1 + ⋯ + n = n(n+1)/2`.

Note that we prove the following after coercing to rational numbers.
We could also prove it in `ℕ` (with natural number division),
but it is more annoying to work with natural number division. -/

prove something for all `n ≥ m` by proving it for `m`
and proving it for `k + 1` if it holds for `k`. -/
